## Wellcome to The Special React Native Template

  - Hello the React Native Deverloper, My name is Jackson Nguyen, I'm very honored when you use this template.
  - This is a React Native open-source template based on the Expo SDK, along with a combination of Mobile Ant Design, Redux, Redux-Sagas etc. (I have mentioned the libraries used under the Libraries section). I'm very grateful to the people who created this library. And I made this template called The Special React Native Template that combines these libraries together. Hope to be a great contribution to the React Native Deverloper community.
  - Final. Let's Enjoy it.
